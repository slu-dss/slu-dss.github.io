Please join us for a new event we are sponsoring - the first of what we hope will become an annual series of meetups for the open science and open source community on campus. We are bringing together open science practioners and users of open source software from around the SLU community to help faculty, research scientists, staff, and graduate students network. Our secondary goal for this event is to set an agenda for open science at SLU.

We will host an informal coffee hour with light hors d'oeuvres, and then provide an overview of the state of open science and open source software at SLU. This will include some discussion of current academic programs, the DSS itself, and the release of our *forthcoming* survey of open science coursework. We'll use that as a basis to discuss the opportunities and challenges for open science at SLU. 

After we conclude a discussion, everyone is invited to our inaugural SLU DSS happy hour at Urban Chestnut (3229 Washington Ave, St. Louis, MO 63103). The happy hour will start at 4:30.

If you are interested in open science or using software like `R` and Python, please come join us!
