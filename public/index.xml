      <description>We are a collaborative, interdisciplinary group at Saint Louis University focused on building community around open source software and open science. Our goal is to bring faculty, students, and staff together from around the University in a way that bridges traditional barriers to collaboration and learning within colleges and universities. We are also dedicated to creating a welcoming, inclusive data science community here at SLU (see the &amp;lsquo;Inclusion and our Code of Conduct&amp;rsquo; section below).</description>

      <description>Beginning in Fall 2017, we started hosting single sessions that targeted specific skills. We like the format as an addition to the multi-part seminar series we offer each semester. We are hoping to use it to give SLU faculty, staff, and students the opportunity to showcase the awesome things they are doing with open-source tools (like R, Python, or Julia) in their research or teaching. If you have something you&amp;rsquo;d like to showcase, let us know!</description>

      <description>The SLU Data Science Seminar is the host of Chris Prener&amp;rsquo;s openGIS project. The project is a collaborative effort with SLU students to curate and host GIS data about the St. Louis area in an accessible manner. We also maintain several R packages that contain tools for working with spatial data. If you are interested in participating in either data curation or R software development, please email Chris.</description>

      <description>Accessible Data Analysis: Using St. Louis Data to Explore Global Issues In this workshop, we&amp;rsquo;ll use publicly available data about St. Louis to introduce open source data analysis software (R) that can be used to explore and respond to questions that are of concern to communities worldwide. We’ll use two local datasets to introduce participants to the art of data analysis: information on income, and asthma rates, for St. Louis.</description>

      <title>Brownbag: Meta-Analysis in R</title>

      <description>Please join us for another installment of our occasional brownbag series. Assistant Professor Cort Rudolph, from the Department of Psychology, will be giving a short overview of techniques for producing meta-analyses using R. Meta-analysis is a statistical technique for evaluating the effects found in multiple scientific studies. No experience with meta-analysis is required. While some basic familiarity with R is helpful, it is also not required.

      <description>The four sessions for the Spring 2018 seminar will cover ways to use R for managing research projects. We’ll discuss how to write functions that automate repetitive tasks, how to include those functions in your own package, and how to track your package development work using Git and GitHub. No prior experience with R, package development, Git, or GitHub is necessary!

      <description>Our Fall, 2017 seminar series will be a four-part introduction to working with spatial data in R. We&amp;rsquo;ll cover the basics of spatial data structures, merging data frames, and using ggplot2 to create maps. No experience with R, GIS work, or mapping is required! Please note that we ask that participants commit to all four seminar dates.

      <description>On September 6th, we will be hosting a short one-hour seminar focused on some general strategies for protecting your research data against hard drive failure, structure fires, natural disasters, and other calamities. If you&amp;rsquo;ve ever worried about what would happen to your work if this happened at your home or in your office but aren&amp;rsquo;t sure how to back your data up effectively, this seminar is for you! We&amp;rsquo;ll introduce some basic strategies and have plenty of time for Q &amp;amp; A.</description>

      <description>We are a collaborative, interdisciplinary group at Saint Louis University focused on building community around open source software and open science.
We host a seminar series focused on the programming language R each semester. We also provide a forum for brownbag sessions where SLU faculty, staff, and students can share open source data anlysis skills. More details about our projects and our commitment to creating an inclusive, welcoming data science community are available on our About page.</description>
